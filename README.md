Sinabs (Sinabs Is Not A Brain Simulator) is a python library for the development and implementation of Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs).
The library implements several layers that are `spiking` equivalents of CNN layers.
In addition it provides support to import CNN models implemented in torch conveniently to test their `spiking` equivalent implementation.
This project is managed by SynSense (former aiCTX AG).
