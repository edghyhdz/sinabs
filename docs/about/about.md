# About this project

This project was brought to life by Sadique Sheik at SynSense, and over the years has received numerous contributions from Martino Sorbaro, Qian Lio, Felix Bauer, Nogay Küpelioğlu, Gregor Lenz and others. The logo has been designed by Dylan Muir. Sinabs is meant to extend PyTorch by adding stateful and spiking layers, which can then take full advantage of the optimised, gradient-based training mechanisms. You might find that the design of our sequential models differs slightly from that of recurrent layers in PyTorch, as we pass as input a tensor that contains all time steps. We do this so that we can leverage powerful CUDA-supported implementations such as SLAYER and EXODUS, which speed up training across many time steps considerably.
